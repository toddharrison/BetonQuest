BetonQuest allows the creation of fully custom GUIs.

As of now, the former addon "RPGMenu" has been merged into BetonQuest - there are no new features
but it will keep working during the development of 2.0 as opposed to RPGMenu's plugin version.
Many new features will be added to the menu system in 2.0. You can see the ongoing discussion on what
features to add on our [GitHub discussion](https://github.com/BetonQuest/BetonQuest/discussions) page.

The documentation is still on RPGMenu's GitHub wiki:

**All existing RPGMenu users must update their RPGMenu config file.
Simply rename it from `rpgmenu.config.yml` to `menuConfig.yml`.**
