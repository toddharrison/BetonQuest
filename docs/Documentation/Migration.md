This guide explains how to migrate from BetonQuest 1.12.X or any BetonQuest 2.0.0 dev build to the latest BetonQuest
2.0.0 dev build.
The migration must be done manually. This will not change while BQ 2.0 is in development!

!!! warning 
    Before you start migrating, you should **backup your server**!

## Changes

Skip to the first version that is newer than the version that you're migrating from:

- [2.0.0-DEV-98 - RPGMenu Merge](#200-dev-98-rpgmenu-merge)
- [2.0.0-DEV-238 - Package Structure Rework](#200-dev-238-package-structure-rework)
- [2.0.0-DEV-337 - Event Scheduling Rework](#200-dev-337-event-scheduling-rework)

### 2.0.0-DEV-98 - RPGMenu Merge

All existing RPGMenu users must update their RPGMenu config file. Simply rename it from `rpgmenu.config.yml` to
`menuConfig.yml`.

### 2.0.0-DEV-238 - Package Structure Rework

- Ensure your server is running on **Java 17**
- Move your current Quests to the folder "_BetonQuest/QuestPackages_"`, as quests are now loaded from there
- Rename all "_main.yml_" files to "_package.yml_"
- Quest packages can now contain nested quest packages in sub folders. You can also have any file and folder structure
  with any file and folder names you want. Only the "_package.yml_" is reserved as indicator for a quest
  package. Learn more in the [Reference](./Reference.md#packages).
  * Therefore, the "_events.yml_`, "_objectives.yml_", "_conditions.yml_", "_journal.yml_" and "_items.yml_" files must
    be updated to the following format:
    Every type that was previously a separate file with a special name is now identified by a "parent-section". It's
    the names of the types / the names the file previously had. Let's take a look at an example for events and conditions:
  
    !!! info "Example"
        === "Old Way"
            ``` YAML title="events.yml"
            myEvent: "teleport 1;2;3;world"
            myOtherEvent: "point level 1"
            ```
            ``` YAML title="conditions.yml"
            myCondition: "location 300;200;300;world"
            ```
        === "New Way"
            ``` YAML title="events.yml"
            events:
              myEvent: "teleport 1;2;3;world"
              myOtherEvent: "point level 1"
            ```
            ``` YAML title="conditions.yml"
            conditions:
              myCondition: "location 300;200;300;world"
            ```
            As described in the previous paragraph, the events and conditions must not be in the same file anymore.
            You could also do this or use any file structure:
            ``` YAML title="anyFileName.yml"
            events:
              myEvent: "teleport 1;2;3;world"
              myOtherEvent: "point level 1"
            conditions:
              myCondition: "location 300;200;300;world"
            ```
    !!! warning 
        You must do this change for all types, not just events and conditions! 

- Alongside the previous change, **conversations** and **menus** must also be updated to the following format:
  Add an extra prefix matching their type and the file name:

    !!! info "Example"
        === "Old Syntax" 
            ``` YAML title="lisa.yml" 
            quester: Lisa
            first: option1, option2
            NPC_options:
              option1:
              # ...
            ```
        === "New Syntax"
            ``` YAML title="anyFileName.yml"
            conversations:
              lisa: #(1)!
                quester: Lisa
                first: option1, option2
                NPC_options:
                  option1:
                  # ...
            ```

            1. This key is now the conversation name that you must refer to when linking NPCs to conversations. 

            Or alternatively:
            ``` YAML
            conversations.lisa:
              quester: Lisa
              first: option1, option2
              NPC_options:
                option1:
                # ...
            ```
                  
### 2.0.0-DEV-337 - Event Scheduling Rework

- All your static events need to be converted to the new scheduling system.
  The [`realtime-daily`](./Schedules.md#daily-realtime-schedule-realtime-daily) schedule makes this easy:
  
    !!! info "Example"
            ```YAML title="Old Syntax"
            static:
              '09:00': beton
              '11:23': some_command,command_announcement
            ```
            ```YAML title="New Syntax"
            schedules:
              betonAt09: #(1)!
                type: realtime-daily #(2)!
                time: '09:00' #(3)!
                events: beton #(4)!
              cmdAt1123:
                type: realtime-daily
                time: '11:23'
                events: some_command,command_announcement
            ```
  
            1. A name for the new schedule.  
              Can be anything you want for organizing your schedules.
        
            2. The type schedule `realtime-daily` was created for easy updating.   
              It behaves just like the old static events.
        
            3. The former key is now the time value.  
              You still have to put it in 'quotes'.
        
            4. The former value is now the events value.
