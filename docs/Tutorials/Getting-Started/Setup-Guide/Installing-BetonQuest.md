# Installation
1. In order to use [BetonQuest](https://betonquest.org/) you (obviously)
   need to add the "_BetonQuest.jar_" that you downloaded from Spigot to the "_plugins_" folder in the server.

    !!! warning "Dev Build Documentation Disclaimer"
        You need the latest BetonQuest 2.0.0 [dev build](https://betonquest.org/) for this tutorial.

2. You also need [Citizens](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/13811/) for this
   tutorial. If you can't afford to buy it you can download it for free.
   Just give the first paragraph of their Spigot page a good read, and you will find the link to the free download.
   Also put the "_Citizens.jar_" file in your server's "_plugins_" folder.

3. You also need [ProtocolLib](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/1997/) for this
   tutorial. Also put the "_ProtocolLib.jar_" file in your server's "_plugins_" folder.

**Once you have installed these restart your server!**
