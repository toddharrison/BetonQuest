**BetonQuest 2.0 is currently in development.**  
This will take some time. Any part of the API may change more than once during development.
Sure, any API is supposed to be stable. But we cannot guarantee this - BetonQuest 2.0 includes many redesigns
of core concepts. It's possible that these turn out to be flawed.  
However, API states help you understand how finalized an API part is.

<h3><u>Unfinished</u> </h3>
This part of the API is brand-new.
It will be changed if there are any bugs, missing features or usability improvements.

**It is not recommended relying on this part of the API, it will most likely change.**

<h3><u>Draft</u></h3>
Our own usage and testing has shown that this part of the API is complete and seems bug free.
However, other plugins may have other use cases which are not covered by our testing.
Therefore, please go ahead and use this API part. Let us know if there are missing features or bugs.
This API part will be changed if there are more bugs, missing features or usability improvements.

<h3><u>Stable</u></h3>
Both our own and third party testing showed that this part of the API is complete.
Only bugs and major conceptual problems would lead to more changes.
